Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of C++
with the libxerces-c library providing support for validating, parsing,
manipulating, and generating XML documents using the DOM, SAX, and SAX2
APIs. For more information see:

http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/

This package contains the original libxerces-c library source code overlaid
with the build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager
(bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the library itself to
the Xerces-C++ mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback
to the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for
posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of Xerces-C++ for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:
